  <h1 class="body-header">Definition of Normal Distribution</h1>
  <p class="body-text">
    The <span class="bold">Normal Distribution</span>, also known as the Gaussian distribution
    (more detailed explaination <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">here</a>), 
    is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the 
    mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In this interactive guide, 
    we'll explore the fascinating properties of the normal distribution through practical 
    and engaging visualizations.
